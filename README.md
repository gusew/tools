# A collection of small tools for evaluations

## Tools

* benchprocpar - Mini benchmark that starts multiple parallel processes in order to evaluate how performance scales on actual systems.
* fiotools - Set of tools with a configurable input and output behavior of processes.
* iologger - Toolchain for interposing system calls with SystemTap.
* memsched - Iteratively allocate blocks of a specified size of main memory and free again.
* exampletask - Dummy task implementation that imitates data processing by reducing or increasing the data size.
* synthcellsim - A toolsuite for executing two-dimensional grid simulations.
